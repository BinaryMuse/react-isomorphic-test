This is a simple test for creating an isomorphic React application.

Running
=======

With Node.js installed:

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`
2. Build the client bundle with `npm run build`
3. Start the server with `npm start` (you can specify a port with `PORT=4321 npm start`)

You can now load the app and add and remove todos (warning: this is *very* rudimentary). You can `curl` the URL and see that the server correctly renders the content.
